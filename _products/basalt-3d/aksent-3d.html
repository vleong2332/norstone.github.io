<h2 class="xx-large color-primary" style="font-weight: normal">The Aksent 3D Panel Collection</h2>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary"><em>Modern Tile, Crafted By Hand.</em></h3>
<p>Comprised of precision-cut blocks of natural stone, our new interlocking modern tiles are hand-assembled with absolute &amp; exacting standards. The result is a thin stone veneer so refined - so perfectly linear - that a completed
  installation will leave you with a new feeling of modernity and class. These modern wall tiles are perfect for contemporary commercial and residential facades, retaining walls, broad feature walls, and tall <a href="/gallery/application/fireplace">stone fireplaces</a>.
  Aksent 3D Panels are available across the range of primary design colors including <a href="/products/aksent-modern-tiles/white-stone/">White</a>, <a href="/products/aksent-modern-tiles/beige-marble-veneer/">Beige</a>, <a href="/products/aksent-modern-tiles/grey/">Grey</a>, and <a href="/products/aksent-modern-tiles/ebony/">Ebony</a>.</p>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Interlocking Ends Ensure a Seamless Installation. Every Time.</h3>
<p>Aksent Modern Tiles offer a "stepped" interlocking edge profile whereby one panel will interlock tightly into its neighboring panel. This system eliminates vertical seams, providing a clean, seamless look across your wall while still leveraging
  the easy to install nature of a panel system.</p>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary">One Corner System to Rule Them All.</h3>
<p>Aksent 3D Tiles incorporate Norstone's World-Class two-part, finger-jointed corner system. Saving every project the head-ache of having to miter their corners, this two-piece system offers a hassle free, interlocking installation, providing a look so
  seamless that it preserves the authentic nature of the stone. Because they require little skill on the part of the contractors fixing our rock panels to a wall, they significantly reduce installation time and onsite labor costs, especially when compared
  to the time and skill involved in cutting and forming mitered corners.</p>

    <h4 class="color-primary">Stone Types</h4>
    <p>White and Beige Marble Aksent 3D Modern tiles are made from marble quarried in Southeast Asia, then rough cut, honed, final cut and assembled into modern wall tiles at our factory. Stretching from Ancient Egypt to the Roman Empire to the buildings of today, Marble is a timeless building material, admired for the intrinsic beauty of natural stone which it so adeptly conveys and coveted for its durability as a building material.</p><p>Ash Grey and Ebony Aksent 3D Tiles are sourced from Basalt Stone, which is an extrusive igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of basalt magmas and lavas at or near the earth’s surface. The un-weathered Basalt that our products are manufactured from exhibit pristine grey to black coloring that has been untouched by the elements for millions of years and is peerless in terms of beauty in the natural stone world, making the Aksent 3D tile the perfect choice for modern wall tile applications.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Norstone Aksent 3D Tiles are made from 100% natural stone and create a modern wall tile look as unique as it is contemporary.</span></p>

    <p><em>For more detailed installation instructions, please visit our <a href="/how-to-install-stacked-stone">installation guide</a>.</em></p>
    <h4 class="color-primary">Installation</h4>
    <p>One of the main benefits of Norstone Aksent 3D is the ease with which they can be installed. The panel system provides for rapid installation over prepared cementitious surfaces, such as cement board, brick / block, or a traditional lathe and scratch
      coat using a polymer modified tile thinset. Aksent 3D is ideally cut on a tile wet saw and are highly calibrated, allowing the installer to interlock one panel into its neighboring panels, thus creating the highly desirable dry stack look and eliminating
      the need to grout or point mortar between individual pieces or units.
      <br>
      <br>Marble and Basalt are porous natural stones and should be sealed in both interior and exterior applications to minimize and prevent any staining of the product. Water based, penetrating sealers should be used and applied per manufacturer's instructions. Variants
      of sealers can tested and used to achieve differing effects and sheens.
      <br>
      <br> The beauty of the Aksent 3D lies in its simplicity, and whether part of a large scale commercial application, or a small residential project, all levels of installers will find the Aksent 3D quick and easy to install and a pleasure to work with.</p>
    <h4 class="color-primary">Natural Stone Sealer</h4>
    <p>Aksent 3D should be sealed with a water based penetrating natural stone sealer.  Different sealers can be applied depending on the characteristics of the application or to achieve a desired look or finish.  Always test sealers on a sample
      piece, off cut, or in an inconspicuous place prior to installing over the entire application.</p>

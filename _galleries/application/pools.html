  body: "Norstone <a href='/products/stacked-stone-cladding/'>Rock Panels</a> can be installed in wet environments without fading, cracking, or unnatural weathering. Being 100% natural stone, Norstone veneers were made outside and have been subjected to wet environments throughout their makeup. If you're looking for a high quality pool stone for your next project, Norstone Stone Veneers products should be on your short list."

  heading: Dimension matters
  body: When choosing a ledgestone veneer for your pool’s risers and spill-ways, consider the fundamental dimensionality to the face of the product. Norstone Rock Panels and XL Rock Panels provide real dimension with world-class design. A stacked stone pool wall using Norstone products will give your project that extra bit of polish that will make your neighbors envious.

  heading: Stone That Lasts
  body: A pool stone wall is subjected to a harsh mix of moisture, chemicals, and sun meaning the products you pick need to be up to the challenge of this tough environment. Norstone products can be submerged because they are 100% natural stone. It’s one of the most durable building products of all time. Chlorine? Salt Water? Go for it. Norstone is made from ultra-dense quartz, basalt, or quartzitic sedimentary rock, which means it stands up to any condition you want to put it through.

  heading: Create Style With Stone
  body: Norstone is the stylish gem in any outdoor living area. A stone veneer waterfall will become the center of attention in a pool setting or some stacked stone knee walls will help outline and define space to aid in creating an outdoor living room to get outside and enjoy. Whether it’s the authentic earth-toned Ochre Blend or the cool toned Charcoal, either Rock Panel can turn your pool, planters and landscaping walls into awe-inspiring features and focal points.

  heading: Practical Considerations
  body: Pools are moisture rich environments, which means they need special care when installing. Norstone can be directly adhered to any pool wall, but we recommend using a waterproofing membrane, such as the Laticrete Hydroban product. Waterproofing your substrate can decrease the chance of efflorescence damaging your Norstone. We also recommend the use of a good quality penetrating sealer. Many exist in the market, but not all are equal. You can learn more from our team, or visit the recommended sealers on our installation guide page.

  heading: A Detail Worth Not Overlooking
  body: More thought goes into the countertop, cabinets, appliances and layout of
    a kitchen, but one detail that anyone building or remodeling a kitchen shouldn't
    overlook is the backsplash. A stacked stone backsplash using Norstone <a href="/products/stacked-stone-cladding">Rock
    Panels</a>        is a unique take on the strip of space commonly found between
    the cabinets and countertop and you might be surprised that it'll end up being
    the first thing people see and talk about.

  heading: An option for every kitchen
  body: A stone backsplash is one of the most durable finishes for the application,
    and by sealing the tile with a natural stone sealer, most household cleanup chores
    will be similar in involvement to other surfaces like ceramic and glass tile.
    So whether your kitchen is used hard every day, or barely used at all, Norstone
    Rock Panels make a great backsplash tile option.

  heading: Details make the Difference
  body: Subtle details, such as under cabinet lighting or switch plates made of similar
    materials will allow your natural stone backsplash to pop off the wall. Dimmable
    incandescent lighting can be used to wash light over the tile backsplash, bringing
    out its warmer tones, and the panels themselves can be notched and your outlets
    and electrical boxes extended out to allow for your outlets and switches to be
    mounted at the same elevation as the stone.

  heading: The Start of Something Bigger
  body: A stacked stone backsplash is a great introduction into working with natural
    stone rock panels and getting a feel for how versatile of a product it can be,
    springboarding the product into lots of other uses. Quickly, you'll be able to
    see how a half wall in the breakfast nook, fireplace in the living room, or media
    wall in the den could use a makeover and how stacked stone might be a good fit.

  heading: Practical Considerations
  body: Sealing the tiles in your kitchen or bathroom stone backsplash is highly advised,
    allowing for much easier routine maintenance and cleaning of the application.
    From an installation standpoint, the backsplash is typically installed after the
    countertop, so care should be taken to cover the countertop during installation
    of the backsplash panels. While the backsplash panels can be installed all the
    way down to the countertop, you should guard against harsh, specifically acidic,
    cleaning agents coming into contact with the stone.

  heading: A Bold Choice in a Sea of the Same
  body: A stacked stone tile backsplash is a design choice that will stand out in the endless run of glass and small format porcelain and ceramic tile that dominate current backsplash trends. A stone veneer backsplash tells your friends and family you value traditional, natural materials but are bold enough to use it in a space often overlooked and devoid of design.

  heading: Small Project - Big Return
  body: A stacked stone kitchen backsplash might only be a small part of a bigger kitchen remodel, but just like door pulls and outlet covers, its something everyone will see and thus can create value to potential buyers. Whether you use a stacked stone backsplash tile like our Basalt Interlocking product, or our Rock Panel product to create a rock backsplash look, both are sure to add lots of value to your project.

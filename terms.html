  tested the materials and received the appropriate approvals from a qualified engineer
  before using the material in a given application. Customer assumes any and all liability,
  be it civil or statutory, arising out of the sale, transport, unloading, installation
  or use of the material at any moment past, present, or future throughout the Universe.

  Agreement is NOT for the benefit of any third party. In the event a third party
  makes a claim against the Seller, Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and hold the
  Seller harmless form any and all claims that exceed Seller’s obligation under this

  Buyer will inspect material before material is unloaded from the freight hauler.
  After receipt of materials, all sales are final.
- COLLECTION PROVISIONS. It is agreed that the applicant/Buyer will pay Seller’s reasonable
  attorney’s fees, costs and expenses in any action for the collection of amounts
  due hereunder. The buyer waives trial by jury in any action brought in connection
  with this Agreement.
- DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THERE IS NO IMPLIED WARRANY OF MERCHANTABILITY
  AND THERE IS NO IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR BUYER’S PARTICULAR PURPOSE; THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR BUYER’S
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES WHICH EXTEND BEYOND
  THE DESCRIPTION ON THE FACE HEREOF. In the event a jurisdiction does not allow the
  exclusion of certain warranties, Seller’s warranties in such jurisdiction shall
  be limited to the extent permitted by law.
- OXIDATION OR STAINING ARISING FROM&nbsp;NATURAL STONE. Norstone Materials are made
  from Natural Stone and may contain deposits of minerals such as iron that may react
  to moisture. Stone bleed or rusting is a common example of this. A sealer is required
  but will not prevent the chemical reaction from happening. Seller is NOT responsible
  for staining or oxidation arising from naturally occurring mineral deposits found
  within the natural stone.
- FIELD MEASUREMENTS/DRAWINGS. Seller is NOT responsible for making, verifying, or
  ensuring the accuracy of field measurements, architectural drawings, specs, or engineering
  approval for the materials sold hereunder. Buyer is solely responsible for acquiring
  appropriate construction approvals from a qualified engineer as per State and /or
  Federal law, for testing and assessing the suitability of materials for a given
  application, and for installing the materials in a safe manner consistent with State
  and or Federal law.
- BUYER’S OBLIGATION TO ASSESS MATERIALS, BUILDING CODE COMPLIANCE, AND ASSUMPTION
  OF LIABILITY. Buyer hereby fully assumes any and all liability of whatever kind,
  arising out of the sale, resale, transport, unloading, installation or use of the
  Materials purchased hereunder. In addition, Buyer assumes all responsibility and
  liability for assessing the suitability of any Materials purchased hereunder for
  a particular purpose. If Buyer is to install any Materials sold hereunder, Buyer
  is bound by the Agreement to have the specific item to be used in a given application
  tested both chemically and mechanically, and to have said specific item and the
  test results done thereon approved for the specific application for which it will
  be used by a building engineer who is licensed in the jurisdiction wherein the installation
  will take place; Buyer is further bound by the Agreement to have the installation
  plans for any installations to be installed by Buyer approved by a building engineer
  who is licensed in the jurisdiction wherein the installation will take place prior
  to installation, to acquire appropriate construction licenses and approvals from
  any and all entities which have jurisdiction over the construction, to insure the
  installation is International Building Code (“IBC”) compliant prior to installation,
  and, if Buyer is not a licensed and bonded construction contractor in the jurisdiction
  wherein the installation will take place, to hire a construction contractor who
  is licensed and bonded in the jurisdiction wherein the installation will take place
  to install the materials in a safe manner consistent with all applicable regulations,
  statues, or codes, including but not limited to the IBC.
- FORUM SELECTION. Both parties agree to bring suit only in the Florida State Courts.
  BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FLORIDA STATE COURTS FOR ADJUDICATION
  OF DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. Violation of this covenant will bar recovery
  by BUYER in any other court.
- INVOICES &amp; PAYMENT. Invoices for materials sold hereunder will be provided to
  Buyer as material is fabricated. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice unless other
  terms are specifically agreed to in writing. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice
  date whether or NOT buyer has been paid by the owner or other Contractor. Failure
  of Buyer to pay Seller in accordance with the payment terms of this Agreement is
  a breach and relieves Seller of the obligation to ship material to Buyer, after
  such breach by Buyer; Seller may require full payment in advance for further delivery
  of materials to Buyer. If buyer, for any reason, does not pay balance to seller
  upon receipt of material or 48 hours thereafter, buyer agrees to compensate seller
  for 5% of total value of shipment for every initiated calendar day thereafter until
  full payment is complete unless otherwise agreed to in writing.
- No Alterations. Buyer should double check their purchase order prior to placement;
  Because certain materials may not be re-sellable by Seller in various markets or
  at certain price points, and because certain opportunities for profit may be lost
  by Seller by tying up the production facilities for a given purchase order, or for
  various other reasons, once a given purchase order has been placed, or deposit accepted
  by Seller, or production started on a given project, or all of the above, NO ALTERATIONS,
  including but not limited to cancellation, are permitted to the purchase order.
  If Buyer wishes to alter a given purchase order after the fact, such an alteration
  will be deemed to be a new and separate purchase order, and Seller may, at its sole
  discretion, require Buyer to pay for a portion, up to and including 100%, of the
  original purchase order, in addition to paying in full for the new materials placed
  under the new/altered purchase order, prior to releasing any materials.
- LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Under no circumstances shall Seller, any of its subsidiaries,
  affiliates, franchisees, agents, employees, licensees, subcontractors, or any third
  party providers be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
  circumstantial or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for
  loss of profits, goodwill, or other intangible losses. The foregoing limitation
  applies regardless of the nature or theory of law upon which such any alleged liability
  is based. In the event a jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or limitation
  of certain damages, Seller’s liability in such jurisdiction shall be limited to
  the extent permitted by law.
- PUBLIC PROJECTS. Upon request, Buyer will supply Seller with a copy of Buyer’s Labor
  and Material Payment Bond prior to initial shipment of material on public projects.
- SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this agreement is determined to be unenforceable
  or invalid, the unenforceable or invalid part shall be deemed severed from this
  agreement and the remaining portions of this agreement shall be carried out in the
  same force as if the severed portions had NOT been part of this agreement.
- DELIVERY &amp; LEAD TIME. Delivery times are an estimation only and subject to responsibilities
  and capabilities of the shipping company. Once the shipment leaves Seller’s warehouse,
  the Seller is not responsible for
- FORCE MAJEURE. Seller shall not be liable for damages resulting from delays in shipment
  or inability to ship due to normal production and shipment delays or those resulting
  from acts of God, fires, floods, tsunamis, wars, sabotage, accidents, labor disputes
  or shortages, plant shutdown or equipment failure, voluntary or involuntary compliances
  with any law, order, rule or regulation of governmental agency or authority; or
  inability to obtain material (including power and fuel), equipment or transportation,
  or arising from any other contingency, circumstances or event beyond the control
  of the Seller.
- SELLER’S QUALITY OBLIGATIONS. Stone is a natural product and as such has a wide
  degree of variance in color and texture from batch to batch, or even within the
  same batch. Every effort has been made to accurately represent the products that
  Seller and/or its vendors and assigns carry, however a wide degree of variance from
  pictures and control sample provided to buyer is inevitable and should be expected.
  Material ordered in two separate purchase orders SHOULD BE EXPECTED NOT TO MATCH,
  particularly if the orders are months apart. Seller warrants that the Materials
  provided will at such time as the Materials are released into Buyer’s care, be at
  least 95% intact (allowing for 5% breakage), be it at the port or Seller’s warehouses
  if the Materials are released to Buyer’s freight hauler at port or from Seller’s
  warehouses, or at Buyers' place of business or residence if Seller ships the material
  over land (DDP), and that at such time as the Materials are released into Buyer’s
  care, they will be of Seller’s standard quality, i.e. reasonably consistent in color
  with control sample and pictures provided by Seller to Buyer.
- ADDITIONAL TERMS. Additional Terms may apply to a given purchase order at Seller’s
  sole discretion on a case by case basis. These will be delineated as "Additional
  Terms" in the written proposal/invoice associated with the purchase order, and will
  incorporate and where applicable amend these Terms and Conditions, and be subject
  to review, but not modification, by Buyer, prior any purchase orders being affected
  by the policy change being executed; such Additional Terms shall be binding on Buyer
  as part of this Agreement upon Buyer's execution of the given purchase order in
  question.
- BREACH BY BUYER. In the event Buyer does not comply with any of the Terms and Conditions,
  Seller may at its discretion cancel sale, retain possession of materials sold hereunder,
  and if applicable pursuant to clauses 2 and 16 hereto, apply an applicable portion
  of monies received of Buyer to cover any applicable expenses, and return the remaining
  portion thereof, if any, to Buyer.
- SUPERCEDING CLAUSE. This document contains the terms and conditions upon which Seller
  offers this sale for materials and/or services on the projects referred to herein.
  Buyer hereby acknowledges that the terms and conditions contained in this document
  supersede all conflicting or otherwise inconsistent terms and conditions contained

One of our great A&amp;amp;D teams based out of Tampa worked with the interior design firm on this project, who were looking for a durable wall finish for the long central corridor of the first floor, but also had a specific color range they needed to stick to.  Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Ochre Blend XL Series Pane&lt;/a&gt;l was originally under consideration, but after an initial round of feedback with the design team, they were looking for something a little lighter and more vibrant in color, so we took a risk and showed them a product that we had only prototyped to that point, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/aztec/&quot;&gt;Aztec XL Stone Veneer panel&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a perfect match color-wise and so we set our production team off to the races to complete the order in time for the grand opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/27/Aztec%20Stacked%20Stone%20Vener%20Hotel%20Lobby%20Orlando.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aztec Stone Veneer used in hotel lobby main corridor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a small lobby, the dominating feature of the first floor of this hotel is the long corridor which runs from the front entrance, past the elevators and conference rooms, to the rear of the hotel where most of the parking is located.  The design team knew this was going to be an important space – visually it needed to be welcome and interesting, and from a performance standpoint it needed to look great day in and day out.  The Aztec stone veneer was a perfect choice because its light earth tone color pallete is nice and bright and the durability of stone is unmatched in a commercial environment.  Incidental contact with a baggage cart will mark, scratch, and dent popular wall coverings like painted drywall or wallpaper, making stone veneer a great choice for long term commercial durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/27/Aztec%20Stone%20Veneer%20Neutral%20Color%20Pallete.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aztec Stone Veneer with Neatural Earth Tone Color Pallete&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color-wise the Aztec also fit into the scheme of the other surface materials.  The somewhat nontraditional choice of a light olive base wall color complements the lighter earth tones of the Aztec stone veneer.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/flooring-for-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;light colored flooring is an excellent choice to match the stone&lt;/a&gt; and keeps everything bright and the dark wood stained trim does a nice job as an accent color and to create definition between the flooring and the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;Lighting natural stone walls&lt;/a&gt; is something we can never overstate the importance of – it can make a space go from normal to amazing with the flick of a switch.  The design team knew that even though this hallway would be well lit up 24 hours a day, some extra attention in the form of directional recessed can lighting can make a huge impact.  The texture of the stone veneer really comes out with the lighting and when looking at the stone head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small but important detail that mainly goes unnoticed is the nice baseboard that separates the stone veneer wall and tile flooring.  While the color creates great contrast and definition, the practical aspect of this baseboard, functioning to keep the chemicals and other cleaning agents used to clean the floor off the stone on the wall is priceless.  Commercial spaces, like this hotel lobby / corridor, first and foremost needs to be practical in both everyday and long term use.  A great design team, like the one on this project, sweats these details and their clients love them for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sure were pleased this project came around to kick start the production and promotion of our Aztec XL Stone Veneer into a product we actively sell and stock in all of our US warehouses.  It’s a great color and is great alternative to our Ochre Blend color, for projects that still want to stick with the neutral earth tones, but want an overall lighter and brighter look.

We were, and still are, one of the few manufacturers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/ledgestone-norstone-industry-series/&quot;&gt;ledgestone veneer&lt;/a&gt; panels that uses quartz and quartzite based stone in our products.  More recently, the term quartz is most often seen when discussing building materials relating to solid surface counter tops and we now frequently hear from clients that are more familiar with the counter top version of quartz than the actual quartz stone itself.  Let’s get those questions answered and figure out what the difference between the two really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/19/Raw%20Quartz%20Stone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quartz Stone in Raw Crystal Form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, quartz is a mineral made up of silicon and oxygen, linked together in a specific framework which allows quartz to have its natural crystalline make up.  Quartz is actually the second most abundant mineral on the earth’s crust!  Both Quartz Stone Veneer and Quartz Counter Tops are made of the quartz mineral, hence the name, but are actually very different in their composition and properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/19/White%20Quartz%20Rock%20Panel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Quartz Rock Panel Studio Shot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most stone veneer made from Quartz, including products like our White and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/charcoal/&quot;&gt;Charcoal Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, is actually made from a derivative of quartz called Quartzite.  This is made through heating and pressure of quartz sandstone, resulting in a hard durable rock.  In other words, mother nature takes this prolific mineral found on the earth’s crust, and over the course of millions of years heats and compresses it into a very hard and durable stone.  Some of the benefits of using quartz beyond just its durability is the overall consistency of the product in terms of color and composition, as well as the workability of the raw stone, allowing it to be split, cut and otherwise fabricated into a variety of different finished stone products.  Most quartz also has a low to non existent iron content which helps prevent the problems associated with oxidation that other stones, namely slate, can experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/19/Quartz%20Countertop%20Kitchen%20Island.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;White Quartz Countertop on kitchen island in renovated kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quartz Counter tops are actually a man-made material, where crushed quartz is mixed with a resin to produce the counter top.  The quartz and resin can be altered to give a range of looks from nearly solid colors to tops that mimic the natural look and feel of many popular natural stone counter top options like granite and marble.  Quartz however resists scratches, burns, and chips better than the aforementioned natural stone materials and also doesn’t need sealed.  With the consistency in color and finish that quartz provides, it has become a popular option for modern design.  While natural stone, namely marble and granite, still own the biggest market share of non laminate counter top materials, engineered stone options like quartz are the fastest growing segment of the counter top market and by 2019 are predicted to account for close to half the overall volume of their natural stone brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team at Norstone loves to play around with new materials and as recently as this spring we prototyped some of our popular rock panel series using cut pieces of quartz stone countertops as the primary material.  Unfortunately we found the man made quartz to be inferior to the quartzite stone we currently use, namely as it related to the stresses associated with moisture and expansion and contraction during freeze thaw cycles.  While we would have loved to come out with a bold color line of Rock Panels in fire engine red, bright yellow, or royal blue, the man made quartz stone just didn’t stand up to the rigors of an exterior installation they way mother nature made quartzite stone does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can easily consider yourself a foremost expert on quartz, with more knowledge than the cabinet and counter top associate at your local home improvement store selling quartz counter tops, or the sales person at your local discount tile retailer that might be selling low quality stone wall veneer.  While this knowledge might not get you many places in life, or even be likely to answer the oddball geology question on Jeopardy, hopefully it does help you understand more about why we choose to make many of our products from quartz and quartzite based stone and what the difference is between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/fireplace/&quot;&gt;Norstone fireplace&lt;/a&gt; you’re thinking about doing this fall just in time for the holidays and the counter top you had installed last year.  As always, our staff is well trained in all thing stone, so bring us your quartz,or any other stone related questions, and we’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">More people than ever know the term quartz from the increasingly popular solid surface countertop material, but few know that the quartz stone that we make a lot of our natural stone veneer and tile products isn't the same thing.

Our office, warehouse, and employee’s homes were thankfully spared from any severe damage caused by the storm, but many of our employees and our warehouse are still without power, putting normal life on hold.  Many of our long time dealers scattered throughout Florida are still without power and have experienced major destruction to their showrooms and I’m sure their employee’s homes, particularly in the hardest hit areas of Southwest Florida.  We’ll lift these folks up and come together as a tile and stone community to help rebuild and help each other wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hurricane experience reminded us of another hurricane event that a featured project of ours played a large role in – the Revel Casino boardwalk in Atlantic City, NJ, which was hit hard by Hurricane / Superstorm Sandy in October of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/13/Revel%20Casino%20Signage%20on%20Stacked%20Stone%20Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Signage on Revel Casino Stacked Stone Wall in Atlantic City, NJ as seen from the boardwalk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say this project was star crossed from the beginning is somewhat of an understatement.  We initially started working with the design firm in late 2008 on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-stacked-stone-on-curved-walls/&quot;&gt;serpentine stone wall&lt;/a&gt; that would separate the hotel and casino from the famed Atlantic City Boardwalk.  The project fell victim to the great economic downturn of the late 2000s and ended up in a cycle of bankruptcy and new ownership many times.  We spoke to multiple contractors for several years who submitted bids only to see the project change hands and fall into bankruptcy.  The project finally got off the ground and moving again in 2011 when we delivered the first of several container loads of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/charcoal/&quot;&gt;Charcoal Stacked Stone Veneer&lt;/a&gt; to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/13/Norstone%20Charcoal%20Stacked%20Stone%20Wall%20at%20Revel%20Casino%20Atlantic%20City%20Boardwalk.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Charcoal stacked stone wall at Revel Casino in Atlantic City&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, this project in the the tens of thousands of square feet of stone was the biggest job we had ever worked on, and seeing it come together was really special.  In these photos taken during construction we loved how the curves of the wall worked so nicely with the curves of the first couple floors of the tower itself.  The curves then also form a cool juxtaposition with the traditional chevron pattern of the boardwalk. As we’ve looked at before, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/modern-stacked-stone-masterpiece-in-asheville-nc/&quot;&gt;the monochromatic charcoal color of the stone has a great modern feel&lt;/a&gt;, and in the case of the Revel the stone complements the steel and glass facade of the tower and made this property truly standout, particularly against some of the older casino properties in Atlantic City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/13/Norstone%20Charcoal%20Stone%20Wall%20at%20Revel%20Casino%20Atlantic%20City%20Boardwalk.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Charcoal stacked stone wall along boardwalk at the Revel Casino in Atlantic City, NJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut outs designed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;up and down lighting on the stacked stone&lt;/a&gt; offered up a great visual break in a large scale project like this.  The random placement and size of the cut outs also help create visual interest on a wall of this magnitude.  The bluestone cap material was so large that it had to be lowered into place and set with the use of a small crane, and matches up very well color wise with the charcoal stacked stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/13/Revel%20Casino%20Boardwalk%20Hurricane%20Sandy%20Impact.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Damage to Boardwalk from Superstorm Sandy at Revel Casino in Atlantic City&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storm surge associated with Superstorm Sandy pushed the water up and over the boardwalk, flooding this wall.  The Revel Casino made it through the storm mostly unscathed, but Atlantic City as a whole took a major hit from this storm and lost much of its drawing power as a gambling and entertainment destination for many months.  The Revel closed in September of 2014, along with three of the four other casinos in Atlantic City and has since traded hands a few more times, but not re-opened yet.  We look forward to the day when new ownership and the right economic conditions make it possible for this property to re-open and hopefully prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we deal with the clean up of our own recent hurricane experience, the Revel Casino project reminds us of all the impacts a storm like this can cause.  We’d like to thank our customers for bearing with us as we begin shipping orders out today based on carrier availability and look forward to seeing all of our Florida and Southeastern US based wholesale stone and tile partners come back stronger than before over the next couple days and weeks to help Florida and the Southeastern US recover and rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">The Norstone team based in Central Florida lived through Hurricane Irma over the past couple of days, thankfully with little damage to our homes and office.

While our clients are rarely that philosophical, this is undoubtedly a question that comes up a lot when working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;natural stone veneers and tiles&lt;/a&gt; and in many instances is an often overlooked step in a successful installation.  While most professional installers should have the knowledge to know when to seal or not seal an installation, many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-diy-infographic/&quot;&gt;Do It Yourself homeowners that tackle natural stone veneer installations&lt;/a&gt; might get to the end and forget to see if this important step is necessary for their project.  So when should a natural stone veneer job be sealed and why is it so important?  Let’s dive in and learn all about sealing natural stone veneer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/06/Sealed%20Stone%20Veneer%20in%20Shower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Shower Feature Wall that has been sealed to protect and enhance the stone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our natural stone veneer and basalt interlocking tile products we recommend that most exterior projects and all applications in a “moisture rich environment” such as a pool, water feature,or even an indoor shower wall as seen in the photo above be sealed.   Exterior applications need to be sealed based on the type of stone being used and the level of exposure to moisture.  A natural stone product made entirely or in part from slate, which can have high iron content and be susceptible to rust in exterior or wet applications, should most definitely be sealed if used on an exterior or wet application.  That same material, if used in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-stone-patios-designing-norstone-series/&quot;&gt;patio feature wal&lt;/a&gt;l where its unlikely ever to see wind driven rain or other moisture wouldn’t need to be sealed.  When in doubt give one of our reps a call – we’re knowledgeable not only in our products, but in most types of stone veneer and can offer assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/06/Unsealed%20Slate%20Tiles%20Rusting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Slate roofing tiles that have not been sealed and are rusting due to high iron content&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sealing natural stone veneer and tile serves two main purposes, preventing or greatly reducing any discoloration on the face of the stone and making the stone easier to clean.  From a discoloration standpoint, certain types of stone can rust like we see in the photo above showing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/slate-tile-norstone-classroom-series/&quot;&gt;slate tiles&lt;/a&gt; that have oxidized, show mineral streaking, and perhaps most commonly exhibit efflorescence on the surface of the stone.  Sealing the stone isn’t a 100% guarantee that these naturally occurring processes won’t happen, but its the best defense available, and when used in conjunction with the correct installation practices and materials, and a well designed project that effectively moves water away from a stone veneer installation, offers a comprehensive layer of protection.  Sealing the stone also makes what does get on the surface much easier to clean.  Spilled a little red sauce on your white rock panel backsplash getting dinner ready?  If the stone is sealed clean up should be as easy as simple wipe down with a wet cloth or sponge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/06/Sealed%20White%20Quartz%20Natural%20Stone%20Backsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Designer White Quartz Stacked Stone backsplash that has been sealed for easy clean up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, there are many different types of sealer on the market to choose from, we recommend water based, penetrating sealers for our line of natural stone veneer and tile products.  Water based vs solvent based is an important distinction because most professionals and non professionals alike find water based products easier to apply than solvent based.  The penetrating aspect of a sealer is equally as important, as penetrating sealers are designed to be absorbed into the stone, whereas a surface type of coating sealer is designed to bond to the surface.  Penetrating sealers provide superior levels of moisture transmission through the surface of the stone, a very important part of any exterior or moisture rich installation, and also offer very little in the way of color enrichment or surface sheen which many coating sealers will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/06/Partially%20Sealed%20Stone%20Veneer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stone veneer that has been sealed on one side and left unsealed on the other side to show the difference in sheen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting started on any natural stone sealing project, be sure to test your selected sealer on a sample or left over off cut of the stone or tile before applying it to the entire project. As seen in the photo above, a sealer can really change the way a stone looks.  Buying your sealer from a reputable local tile and stone shop is a good idea because many times they’ll have small manufacturer’s samples of the sealers to test out on your stone or tile to make sure its having the desired effect, something you won’t get at the big box stores or online.  Always follow the sealer manufacturer’s instructions for applying the product, and remember a good rule of thumb when applying sealer to natural stone is that multiple light coats are preferred to fewer heavier coats and will result in a better looking seal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sealing is one of those things that looks pretty easy to do, and in reality actually is a fairly simple step in the grand scheme of any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/learning-the-best-practices-for-tile-and-stone-installations-by-the-tile-council-of-north-america/&quot;&gt;natural stone veneer or tile installation&lt;/a&gt;, IF you’re using the right product for the right type of project and applying it correctly.  Expert advice, whether its from an article like this, the manufacturer of your stone product, or one of our super knowledgeable technical staff at Norstone, is worth seeking out as you’re getting started with this phase of your project.  To go back and ponder our philosophical question – To Seal or Not To Seal – I think the answer is most definitely a YES.  Seal your stone applications, spending a little time and money at the start to protect your investment and make owning natural stone easier and more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">A lot of our customers ask us if they should seal their stone and the answer in almost every case is a resounding yes. While its critically important in some installations, such as water features, a case for sealing natural stone veneer can be made for just about any project. In this week's article let's take a closer look at why sealing might just be the most important part of your next natural stone veneer installation.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.norstoneusa.com/%7B%22src%22=%3E%22/uploads/2017/09/06/Sealed%20Stone%20Veneer%20in%20Shower.jpg%22,%20%22title%22=%3E%22Sealing%20Stacked%20Stone%20Veneer%20Installations%22,%20%22alt%22=%3E%22Stacked%20Stone%20Feature%20Wall%20in%20a%20shower%20that%20has%20been%20sealed%20for%20protection%20and%20ease%20of%20use.%22%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Tex Mex and Norstone Basalt Interlocking Tile</title><link href="https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/interlocking-tile-exterior-chipotle/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tex Mex and Norstone Basalt Interlocking Tile" /><published>2017-08-27T20:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-27T20:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/tex-mex-and-norstone-basalt-interlocking-tile</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/interlocking-tile-exterior-chipotle/">&lt;p&gt;The Norstone team loves to eat!  Sometimes we find ourselves dreaming about whats for lunch only to look down at the clock and realize its only 9:45 in the morning – a long haul till lunch time.  We especially love it when one of our favorite quick service restaurants gets a chance to use our products, and this Chipotle in South Florida is no exception.  Let’s dive in and see what made our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/modern-wall-tile/&quot;&gt;basalt mosaic interlocking tiles&lt;/a&gt; a great choice for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/28/Basalt%20Mosaic%20Interlocking%20Tile%20-%20Chipotle%20Florida.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basalt Mosaic Interlocking Tile on Exterior of Chipotle in Florida&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stacked stone and mosaic tile products are often called on by architects, designers and developers for commercial applications because they’re natural stone products and exude a certain sense of luxury and sophistication.  Many times a developer will set a strict guideline for what type of cladding can be used, even on a stand alone restaurant like this, that can require a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/real-stone-vs-faux-norstone-industry-series/&quot;&gt;natural stone veneer be used in place of faux or other manmade stone&lt;/a&gt; and tile products.  This can sometimes leave architects and designers scrambling to satisfy both the requirements of the developer and the brand restrictions of the franchise.  That was certainly the case here as the developer wanted to maintain a high level of design and material usage in the area.  Our Basalt Grey Interlocking Mosaic tiles were a great choice because they fit the color scheme, design standards, overall aesthetic the developer and brand were seeking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/28/Basalt%20Mosaic%20Interlocking%20Tile%20-%20Chipotle%20Door%20Florida-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basalt Mosaic Interlocking Tile with White Grout complementing Chipotle Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ash grey color of the basalt strips is a great complement to the overall branding of this particular restaurant chain.  The grey background really lets the red of the signage pop.  This is a great modern color combination that is eye catching due to its contrast without the need for super bright or loud colors within the same color family.  The predominantly white lettering, both on the signage and on places like the doors subtly works with the white grout the design team specified for this installation.  A grey grout is more commonly used when installing, which creates a little less contrast within the field of the tile and lets the installers have more wiggle room with their accuracy, but the choice of white grout in this installation should be applauded as it accentuates the linear and geometric look of the interlocking tile design and ties into the store’s branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-trends-when-it-comes-to-stone-smooth-is-in/&quot;&gt;smooth and modern look of the Basalt Interlocking Tile&lt;/a&gt; is also a great fit for the overall design aesthetic of this particular chain.  The steel I beam inspired entrance way cover and window border has a decidedly modern and industrial feel to it, to which the smoothness, grey color, and over all geometry of this particular strip mosaic tile play into nicely.  The exterior sets the tone and like most Chipotle restaurants is continued on through the interior décor with long garage style caged lighting, minimalist inspired seating, communal tables, and rough texture wood and osb walls, fully embracing the industrial chic look.  However, fans of this particular mosaic tile and color combination don’t fret – not all modern design, which this tile design is ideally suited for, is industrial – check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/basalt-il-tiles/grey/&quot;&gt;gallery for our basalt grey interlocking tile&lt;/a&gt; for more inspiration on how this tile can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always fun and inspiring to see our interlocking mosaic tile and stacked stone products show up not just on a well respected nationally recognized brand, but also on a place that we ourselves frequent and enjoy.

From a material standpoint the product is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot;&gt;thin natural stone veneer&lt;/a&gt;, but from an installation standpoint since the panel comes pre-assembled into 6”x24” field units, and matching outside corner units and natural ends, the requirements for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/how-to-install-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;successful stacked stone installation&lt;/a&gt; are essentially the same as a tile product.  With those two worlds and schools of thought colliding, we’ve often seen an important installation step get missed  - the waterproofing / anti fracture membrane used for exterior and moisture rich projects.  Let’s take a closer look at what this product is, what it does, and why its so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/learning-the-best-practices-for-tile-and-stone-installations-by-the-tile-council-of-north-america/&quot;&gt;important for certain stacked stone installations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-waterproofing--anti-fracture-membrane&quot;&gt;What is a waterproofing / anti fracture membrane?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product itself is most commonly found as a fluid applied membrane that is applied almost like a very thick paint.  In years past these products also use to come in actual fabric membranes which were set and then top coated with a matching waterproofer, however with the advances in setting material technology most of the industry has switched to fluid applied membranes which are easier to work with and use.  Almost all the fluid applied membranes come out of the bucket a certain color and then change colors when they’re cured and ready for testing, inspection, and to be tiled over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/22/Stone%20Tile%20Waterproofing%20Membrane%20Roll%20on%20Application.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Applying a fabric waterproofing membrane for a tile installation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-a-waterproofing--anti-fracture-membrane-do&quot;&gt;What does a waterproofing / anti fracture membrane do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to look too deep to find out what a waterproofing / crack isolation membrane does – it’s right in the name- waterproofing and crack isolation!  When applied over a proper substrate, the waterproofing aspect of this membrane prevents water from from entering the substrate.  Whether that’s an open wall cavity or cement block, wet substrates are something to avoid at all costs. The second thing these membranes do is provide a layer of anti fracture protection over shrinkage and other non structural cracks in the substrate.  This is especially important in freeze / thaw climates, but really in any environment where the substrate can experience expansions and contraction due changes in temperature and humidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/22/Stone%20Tile%20Waterproofing%20Membrane%20On%20Bath%20Shower%20Surround.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Liquid applied waterproofing membrane ready to receive tile in a shower tub surround&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-waterproofing--anti-fracture-membranes-be-used-for-certain-stacked-stone-installations&quot;&gt;Why should waterproofing / anti fracture membranes be used for certain stacked stone installations?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterproofing / anti fracture membranes are important for stacked stone installations for two main reasons – moisture management and freeze / thaw crack isolation protection.  From a moisture standpoint, a common misconception is that stacked stone installations allow for very little water to penetrate behind the stone and into the substrate.  Unfortunately, that’s simply not true – in fact a stacked stone panel system provides a myriad of gaps between the individual stones where water will find its way behind the stone.  There’s no way to prevent that from happening, and its best controlled via adequate substrate preparation including a waterproofing membrane, which will prevent that moisture from getting into the wall cavity.  By keeping the wall  / wall cavity dry it also prevents any transmission of salts or other mineral solids often found in concrete walls from being pulled out to the surface of the stone, a process called efflorescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/22/Effloresence%20on%20Natural%20Stone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Effloresence showing on the face of natural stone used as the risers on outdoor steps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Membranes also offer crack isolation protection during freeze / thaw cycling, which keeps the installation stable.  Without the stability afforded by an anti fracture / crack isolation membrane during freeze / thaw cycling a tile or stone installation can crack or buckle under the stresses caused by climate induced substrate movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-should-waterproofing--anti-fracture-membranes-be-used-in-stacked-stone-installations&quot;&gt;When Should waterproofing / anti fracture membranes be used in stacked stone installations?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All exterior stacked stone installations should use a waterproofing / anti fracture membrane including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/summer-s-here-jump-into-these-amazing-pools-designed-with-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;pools&lt;/a&gt;, as well as certain “moisture rich” interior installations where water will interact directly with the stone, such as a shower wall or water feature.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s actually several years old, but I had a great time looking back and appreciating some of the unique details of this project, like the closely spaced outside and inside off angle miter cut corner.  Some of our Norstone team lives in the Big Apple, and a bunch of us enjoying swimming for exercise and fun, so this great project is right up our alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/14/Indoor%20Pool%20Ledgestone%20Feature%20Wall%20-%20New%20York%20City.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Indoor Pool Ivory Ledgestone Feature Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the stone is installed on a large feature wall abutting the short end of the pool.  The Ivory color matches up nicely with the light neutral tones of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/travertine-tiles-norstone-designer-series/&quot;&gt;travertine pool coping&lt;/a&gt;, which create a nice contrast with the aqua blue of the pool.  One of the nice features of a stacked stone wall like this is the noise deflection properties of the stone.  Anyone that’s ever spent some time in an indoor pool knows how loud it can be with sound slapping off all the flat surfaces like the deck, windows, ceiling, and even the water which transmits sound exceptionally well.  A highly textured product like ledge stone bounces sound waves off in many different directions, helping to diffuse the sound.  The same reason why our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/project/rockport/&quot;&gt;stacked stone works well in concert halls&lt;/a&gt; is the same reason why it makes this room just a little quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/14/Indoor%20Pool%20Ledgestone%20Feature%20Wall%20-%20New%20York%20City%20Skyline%20Views-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Indoor Pool Ledgestone Feature Wall on New York Rooftop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an indoor rooftop pool, the architect did an excellent job incorporating natural light and taking advantage of the amazing views you get in this prime Manhattan location.  From a design standpoint, the challenge on indoor pools is often how to de-sterilize the feel of the space where the hard surfaces of the deck and pool itself tend to dominate.  The stacked stone feature wall is a great option as it’ll be incredibly durable and easier to maintain than a plain wall or window, but at the same time the ledge stone look brings in a surface with an outdoor/  natural feel to it.  Indoor pools also often suffer from lack of natural light, many even are below ground with no natural light at all, making this surely a selling point for the residents of the building.  The peaked glass ceiling above the pool keeps the sun in and weather out.  And lastly, let’s not forget about the views of the Flatiron district and surrounding areas which give this space a distinctly New York feel, something you can’t say about every pool on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/14/Indoor%20Pool%20Ledgestone%20Feature%20Wall%20Inside%20Outside%20Miter%20Corner%20-%20New%20York%20City.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Indoor Pool knee wall with off angle mitered corners&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a stone company, the part of this installation that really catches our eye is the amazing job the installer has done through a section of half wall where the stone traverses an inside then outside corner in a small area, all at an off angle needing a miter cut.  This knee wall, separating the pool from the stairway does a great job tying together and establishing a design them with the main stacked stone accent wall on the far side of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/14/Indoor%20Pool%20Ledgestone%20Feature%20Wall%20Outside%20Finger%20Joint%20Corner%20-%20New%20York%20City.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Indoor Pool knee wall using Norstone Finger Joint Corner Units&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next photo taken from a slightly different angle shows the difference between our finger jointed corner units, used to turn the outside 90 degree corner from the stairway and the previously mentioned off angle miter cut corners.  Kudos to the installation team for a job well done with the mitered corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not every pool has amazing views of the New York City skyline, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/summer-s-here-jump-into-these-amazing-pools-designed-with-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;pools are a great project to use stacked stone&lt;/a&gt; on.  From the water line tile, to a raised beam water feature, to a knee wall flowing into an outdoor kitchen or lanai, stacked stone is a durable product that will stand up to the test of the harsh pool environment while also creating or adding to the natural feel that most pool design seeks to create.  So whatever your latitude, or whether your pool is inside or outside, be sure to consider a natural stone product for your next pool project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">Swimming and New York City are two things close to the hearts of the team at Norstone, which makes this cool enclosed rooftop pool that used our Ivory Rock Panels on some feature walls a place we'd enjoy getting our laps in before or after the work day.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.norstoneusa.com/%7B%22src%22=%3E%22/uploads/2017/08/14/Indoor%20Pool%20Ledgestone%20Feature%20Wall%20-%20New%20York%20City%20Skyline%20Views.JPG%22,%20%22title%22=%3E%22Ledgestone%20Feature%20Wall%20on%20Indoor%20Pool%20with%20New%20York%20City%20Skyline%20Views%22,%20%22alt%22=%3E%22Ivory%20Ledgestone%20Feature%20Wall%20on%20Indoor%20Pool%20with%20New%20York%20City%20Skyline%20Views%20and%20a%20glass%20roof%22%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Design, Spec, Build – Know the Players of Your Next Construction Project</title><link href="https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-spec-build/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Design, Spec, Build – Know the Players of Your Next Construction Project" /><published>2017-08-06T20:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-06T20:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-spec-build-know-the-players-of-your-next-construction-project-big-or-small</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-spec-build/">&lt;p&gt;Depending on the size of your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;stone veneer&lt;/a&gt; project, a bunch of different people with lots of different skill sets could be involved.  One of the things that can make projects confusing, even for those of us with experience, is that sometimes those skill sets overlap and what role someone may fill on one project can be different on the next project.  To really understand who the players are in a construction project, big or small, let’s take a look at three of the major steps in the process of taking an idea and building it into reality - Design, Specify, Build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design phase of a construction project is pretty clear cut.  The needs and desires of the client are determined and balanced against things like project location, budget, and construction practices.  An architect is often relied on for their expertise in this phase.  For projects both big and small architects perform the crucial role of drafting the detailed blueprints and construction documents necessary for the “build team” to actually take a project through permitting and construct the job with.  These experts take into account things like the added weight a ledge stone accent wall will add and what that means to the structure of a building or construction method of a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/07/Design%20Specify%20Build%20-%20Architect%20Meeting%20with%20Client.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Architect meeting with client during the design phase of a construction project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines blur considerably in the design phase when you start talking about projects that are more renovation in nature, and generally speaking don’t require a building permit, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/light-and-bright-aztec-stacked-stone-backsplash-in-orlando-fl/&quot;&gt;upgrading the tile on a kitchen backsplash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/two-toned-modern-fireplace-in-ft-collins-co/&quot;&gt;adding stone veneer to a fireplace&lt;/a&gt;.  A competent contractor, or sometimes even the homeowner, can fill the gap and perform the design and crucial planning steps for projects in this realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;specify&quot;&gt;Specify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specification phase of a project is always exciting because it involves picking out a lot of the materials to be used and detailing out how specific things are to be built on the project.  While its not quite the same level of satisfaction as seeing concrete get poured or walls get painted, it does often provide a great visual introduction to what the completed project will look like it.  Larger projects will have multiple teams of designers working on specific areas, such as interiors and landscaping, and sometimes the architect even plays a dual role as specifier as well.  Owners and / or owners reps meet frequently with the design team and are heavily involved making material selections during this phase and making sure the project is moving forward and on budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/07/Design%20Specify%20Build%20-%20Design%20Center.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Design center used in the specification and selection phase of a construction project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For smaller projects, homeowners often find themselves in the role of specifier.  They might be re-doing their fireplace in a stone veneer and had the “design” discussion with a quality contractor, but now its up to them to research and find a product that they love and that works for the project.  Depending on the scope of any given project and that homeowner’s desire or ability to make those decisions, many of our clients often enlist the help of a designer, sometimes on an hourly engagement basis, other times handing over complete control of the project, to help with this phase of the project.  It can be intimidating for a homeowner to try and learn everything there is to know about a product like stone veneer or ledge stone, so leveraging an expert is a great way to save time and often times money as well by avoiding costly mistakes in material selection and ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many things in life, successful prep work without taking any short cuts in the Design or Specify phases is the key to a successful Build.  On large projects, clients will be working with a general contractor whose job it is to manage multiple sub contractors performing a variety of work and ensure the construction is being done according to the plans, according to building codes, and to the  expected level of quality their clients demand.  On smaller projects a homeowner can sometimes act as their own general contractor, perhaps working with an electrician to wire some under cabinet lighting on a backsplash project and a tile installer to actually lay and grout the tile.  However the project is being managed, making sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/selecting-the-right-installer-for-your-next-tile-or-stone-project/&quot;&gt;a great contractor is selected&lt;/a&gt; for the work is always important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/07/Design%20Specify%20Build%20-%20Stone%20Veneer%20Installation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stone masons installing stone veneer panels during the build phase of a construction project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the size of the project or how formal or informal each phase is, all successful projects are designed, specified, and built.  Even for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-diy-infographic/&quot;&gt;DIY project&lt;/a&gt; where the homeowner is handling all three phases, laying out the project in this manner will help lead to a successful project, and cut out extra trips to the hardware store or costly re-orders or returns of products that weren’t planned for correctly.

There’s no doubt that a seeing a strong and durable product like stone is an ideal parallel for how banks want to be perceived by the public, especially as it relates to being a safe place to store and save your hard earned money.  While a lot of the banks we’ve worked with have opted for the ledge stone look of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot;&gt;Standard Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/&quot;&gt;XL Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, we really love the cutting edge choices made by the design team of this credit union located in central Washington state.  Not only was the selection of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/basalt-stone-panels/black-stone/&quot;&gt;Ebony Basalt 3D Stone Panel&lt;/a&gt; a bold and modern move, the way it was implemented across various features both on the interior and exterior of this project deserves a  closer look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/02/Basalt%203D%20Ebony%20-%20Commercial%20-%20Credit%20Union%2010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basalt Ebony Stone Veneer on Exterior of Bank as seen from the road&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building as seen from the street looks unlike a traditional bank, with the design of the building jutting off at various sharp angles and an eclectic mix of neutral colors.  Prominent in this elevation is the stone accent wall made of Basalt 3D Panels, which is set slightly in front of the main wall and extends slightly higher than the first floor of the building, creating a nice architectural touch.  The dark color of the stone veneer matches up with the metal trim work used on the rest of the building and serves as a focal point and accenting color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/02/Basalt%203D%20Ebony%20-%20Commercial%20-%20Credit%20Union%2011-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basalt Ebony Stone Veneer used as the background on a bank's signage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up close this stone veneer blade wall is even more interesting to look at.  The design team chose to install the 3D Stone Panels in a vertical orientation, meaning the long dimension of each unit is set along the vertical axis, or 90 degrees off from the more traditional horizontal orientation.  The end result is that vertical orientation accentuates the height of the feature wall.  The clean geometry of the product also shines through in this photo, with the stone veneer panels creating loads of texture with a modern, very clean lined look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/02/Basalt%203D%20Ebony%20-%20Commercial%20-%20Credit%20Union%208.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basalt Ebony Stone Veneer used on the exterior of a bank near the entrance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parking lot approach to the building reveals another distinct stone veneer blade wall, this time juxtaposing a circular entrance way, extending all the way up to become the highest point of the entire building.  We love the off angle nature of this whole building and seeing that continue on the rising slope of this feature wall.  The cut out in the stone accent wall on the second floor right above the entryway is a subtle feature that adds interest and great visuals to the overall design of this exterior installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/08/02/Basalt%203D%20Ebony%20-%20Commercial%20-%20Credit%20Union%203.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basalt Ebony Stone Veneer column bases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A line of architectural pergolas line the paver walkway from the parking lot to the entrance of the bank and the design team thoughtfully chose to clad the bottom of the support columns in the same stone veneer used on the exterior accent walls.  The material not only provides a nice tie in between this space and the main building, but also offers a durable building material option for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stone-veneer-columns-norstone-classroom-series/&quot;&gt;bases of these stone column&lt;/a&gt; supports, without sacrificing anything in the way of look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the outside of this bank didn’t convince you to move your money there, the inside continues to impress with a continuation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/ledgestone-norstone-industry-series/&quot;&gt;exterior ledge stone feature wall&lt;/a&gt; into the lobby area, with the stone going vertical from the floor to the vaulted two story ceiling.  A super cool design on the wall behind the reception desk has the stone veneer fanning out from the ceiling down to the floor and is a great background for the commercial signage.&lt;/p&gt;

The panel system provides a lot of benefits, chief among them the ability for less skilled labor, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-diy-infographic/&quot;&gt;DIY installation of stacked stone&lt;/a&gt; by homeowners.  One of the drawbacks of the panel system is the lack of flexibility of the panel, in particular when working on curved or radius walls.  However, there are lots of great ways products like ours can be used on curved walls, so let’s take a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-install-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;guidelines for using stacked stone&lt;/a&gt; on radius walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-know-the-radius-of-your-wall&quot;&gt;Step 1: Know the Radius of Your Wall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in understanding if a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;stacked stone panel product&lt;/a&gt; will work on a curved wall is to know what the actual curve,or radius of the wall is.  Radius is actually a unit of measure, normally given in feet, and expresses the length from the middle of a circle to the edge.  In other words, if you took a curved wall, and extended that curve out using an imaginary line to complete a full circle, the radius measurement would be how far it is from the center of the circle to any point on your wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/07/24/Stacked%20Stone%20Radius%20Wall%20University%20Lounge.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Curved Wall University Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re working with a set of construction documents or blueprints, the radius is often called out, or can be calculated via many CAD programs.  If you’re retrofitting an existing wall with stacked stone you can tie a string between the two ends of the curved wall, measure the length of the string and the farthest point between the string and the wall, and using your high school trigonometry, or more likely one of many easy to use online calculators, calculate the radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rule of thumb is that any wall with a radius of 20 feet or greater can use our rock panel products without modifying the product.  For walls with radius measurements less than 20 feet, multiple options are explored below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-understand-installation-techniques&quot;&gt;Step 2: Understand Installation Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For walls with radius measurements less than 20 feet the primary methods for making stacked stone panels “fit” is to either cut down the panel into smaller sections and / or cut the edges of each panel for a tighter fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/07/24/Stacked%20Stone%20Radius%20Garden%20Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Curved Garden Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norstone Rock Panels have a standard orientation of 6” tall x 24” wide, so the first step when working on a radius wall less than 20 feet would involve cutting the panels in half (6”x12”).  This introduces twice as many vertical seams into the job which allows the tile to be more flexible along a curved wall since most of the curve is accommodated where two panels come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to cutting the the panels down in size, the vertical edges can be cut with a miter saw to come together more tightly along a tightly curved wall.  This takes the right tools, and some skill and patience, but when done correctly on tight radius work like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/summer-s-here-jump-into-these-amazing-pools-designed-with-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;stacked stone pool and spa surrounds&lt;/a&gt;, the results are amazing.  The garden wall in the photo above was installed personally the CEO of a major tile distribution company in Florida who has a lifetime of tile setting experience, and who &lt;a href=&quot;/client-testimonials/&quot;&gt;personally attested to the ease of installation&lt;/a&gt; of Norstone stone panels in radius applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-understand-convex-vs-concave&quot;&gt;Step 3: Understand Convex vs Concave&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of installing stacked stone on a curved wall is knowing if the stone is going on the convex or the concave side of the curved wall.  Convex means the surface curves outward while concave means the surface curves inward.  When working on a concave wall, the front of the stacked stone panels are going to be the tightest and potentially need some careful trimming for a precise tight fit.  Convex is just the opposite in that the back of the panels might need trimming for a clean fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/07/24/Stacked%20Stone%20Concave%20and%20Convex%20Radius%20Wall%20Outdoor%20Hot%20Tub.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Concave and Convex Curved Wall Outdoor Hot Tub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-consider-alternatives&quot;&gt;Step 4: Consider Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a wall with a tight radius, but absolutely love the look of stacked stone in the space, the one alternative we see many clients go with is flipping the orientation of the panel to 6” wide and 24” tall.  While this definitely changes the look of product, accentuating the long linear feel vertically instead of horizontally, the 6” width of the panel allows for a far more flexible installation.  Don’t be afraid to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/outside-the-box-stone-design-ideas-for-your-next-remodel-or-new-build/&quot;&gt;think outside the box with your next stacked stone installation&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radius walls are in many ways a great design contrast to the traditional flat walls that stacked stone is commonly associated with, and could be a great feature in your next interior or exterior project.

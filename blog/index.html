  <p>When designing a kitchen, there are a lot of little details to think about - cabinets, countertops, appliances, island or no island, flooring and more. The one detail that is often overlooked, or saved for last, is the backsplash - but it shouldn't be!  The backsplash can tie all the little details together and be the finishing touch on the kitchen.
Here are a few design ideas using natural stone as a non traditional backsplash medium.</p>

  <p>There comes a point in most stone veneer projects where the stone will need to go around an outside corner to either continue along, or terminate into another wall or structure. Calculating the right mix of field and corner units for your project the first time around is a critical step to staying on time and in budget.
So don't let an outside corner bring your stacked stone project to a screeching halt - Here's a handy guide that explains how using our Rock Panel series Outside Corner Unit will have you turning corners in no time.</p>

This can be your guide to designing with this crowd favorite, helping you elevate your project from ordinary to extraordinary.</p>

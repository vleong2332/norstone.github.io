  body: Using the right kind of lighting on your Norstone feature wall stone installation will give it life. Make sure you use downward facing low-voltage light to give your installation maximum texture and dimension. Let the light wash down the stone. If you use a spot-light, you risk losing the gorgeous dimension and texture the wall was intended to provide.
